A week later, he announced he is running for Senate. “I’ve always said Washington was a lousy place for a guy like me who wants to get things done – but this is no time to walk away from the table,” the former governor of Colorado said in his announcement video. “… I’m not done fighting for the people of Colorado.” In that video, filmed at the Denver brewpub he founded, Hickenlooper echoed his presidential pitch to voters, which focused on ending the conflict in Washington. And he promised to work on fighting climate change, prescription drug prices and economic inequity.</p>

The former teacher and school principal turned politician is best known for his work on education reform policies, including the state’s teacher evaluation law. This is also why he’s such a polarizing figure in the Democratic Party. During his gubernatorial run, the state’s largest teachers union took the unusual step of financing an attack ad against Johnston. Here’s what he said after announcing his campaign: “When he’s campaigning in Colorado, Cory Gardner claims he’s independent, but when he’s voting in Washington he sticks with Trump 92% of the time. That’s not what Colorado needs. Colorado deserves a Senator with the courage to run toward our toughest problems and the leadership to pass progressive policy on climate, health care, immigration, and gun safety.” Johnston is an early fundraising front-runner after raising $1.8 million in the first three months of 2019.</p>

It’s what I will lead on, it’s the first thing I’ll attack.” Madden ran for statewide office in 2016, losing a University of Colorado regent race by a narrow margin to Republican Regent Heidi Ganahl.</p>
